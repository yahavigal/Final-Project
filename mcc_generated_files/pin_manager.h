/**
  System Interrupts Generated Driver File

  @Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  @File Name:
    pin_manager.h

  @Summary:
    This is the generated manager file for the MPLAB(c) Code Configurator device.  This manager
    configures the pins direction, initial state, analog setting.
    The peripheral pin select, PPS, configuration is also handled by this manager.

  @Description:
    This source file provides implementations for MPLAB(c) Code Configurator interrupts.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  MPLAB(c) Code Configurator - 4.35
        Device            :  PIC24FJ256GA705
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC16 1.32
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X 3.61
